# NSU PlagiChecker - Weekly Report 1 Showcase

This is a standalone version of the frontend interface developed for Weekly Report 1.
It demonstrates the UI design, state management between "Repository Check" and "Diff Checker", and the responsive layout.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## Setup & Run
1. Open a terminal in this directory:
   ```bash
   cd weekly_report_1_showcase
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the link shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Notes
- This is a frontend-only showcase. API calls (file upload) will fail gracefully or show errors because the backend is not included in this package.
- The focus is on the UI/UX and component structure.
